# English-Handwritten-Text-Recognition-and--OCR-
In this project a flexible convolutional neural network is proposed for text recognition. seeks to improve handwritten text prediction using the Neural network on the OCR dataset and the EasyOCR library to extract the whole text from the handwritten text image, then compare it to our model to see if we can outperform the existing EasyOCR model
